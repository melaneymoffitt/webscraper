IN GROWING LONG NATURAL HAIR, NATURAL HAIR CARE ON 10/04/19
How do I get my hair to grow? faster? longer?
These are all common questions. Before we talk about any hair tips, it’s important for you to understand that your hair IS GROWING!!!
There are 3 common reasons why you’re not seeing any hair growth. You can read them here.
In most cases, your hair is breaking at the same rate that it was growing, given the appearance of stunted hair growth.
You may also want to read the Differences Between Hair Growth and Breakage.
The key to growing long, healthy hair is to follow a healthy hair regimen. Growing healthy hair requires proper care and maintenance, and without handling your hair delicately it could lead to serious breakage, hair loss or possible balding.
A healthy hair regimen is a balanced hair regimen that consists of cleansing with a sulfate-free shampoo that is free from harmful chemicals to remove build-up and grime. Follow up with a moisturizing conditioner, a deep conditioner and/or protein treatment as needed to help strengthen, repair and prevent damage of the hair.

Shampoo, Co-Wash and Rinse As Needed
Natural hair by nature is very porous, meaning has a high porosity, and mine is no different.
4 Tips to Lower Your Hair’s Porosity
My scalp and hair need to be cleansed and rehydrated at least every 4-5 days and sometimes, co-washed in between.
A clean scalp promotes healthy hair growth by removing build-up, dead skin, and other unwanted debris. Cleansing more frequently than once a week or twice a week is perfectly ok if you’re using a gentle sulfate-free cleanser.
I discussed this in more detail in my Guide to Healthy Hair.  In between shampoos, I Co-wash or Rinse (run water through my hair without shampoo or conditioner) my hair especially in summer. (Houston, TX has 100°+ heat and my hair needed it.)
Pay Attention To Those Ends
A lot of times we pay less attention to the oldest part of our hair, the ends. They are the last part to receive moisture and product, but they are the first to lose these things. In addition to trimming split damaged ends, you should apply your product for ends to tips. Always, always moisturize and seal your ends.

Less Manipulation
As much as I love to style my hair, it can be somewhat temperamental — and I’ve found that it thrives when left alone. I dare not comb or brush this tightly-curled hair daily, not even every other day. Low manipulation or protective styles, like twists or braids, protect my hair from manual breakage and moisture loss. 
Read: Why You Should Protective Style
Work In Sections
I have been blessed with a very thick head of hair. It’s beautiful, I love it, but it can be challenging. The longer my hair grows, the thicker it becomes.
Everything must be done in 4-6 sections, from shampooing to conditioning to moisturizing to detangling. These ensure full coverage.
Penetrating Oils Work Best
The first few years of my natural hair journey I would slather on the Shealoe (shea butter+ aloe vera gel). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, especially in the winter. Shea butter is a natural moisturizer, great for sealing in the moisture.
The problem is, it only coats my hair. Lighter oils, like coconut or olive oil, actually absorb into the hair, giving it the ability to strengthen and reinforce the hair’s internal structure. Read more about the benefits of penetrating oils.

The Hooded Dryer is Your Friend
I’m not sure how the hooded dryer got a bad rep, although I think there’s confusion about heat damage. There’s actually a greater chance of heat damage with blow dryers than there ever will be with a hooded dryer, according to Audrey Davis-Sivasothy, author of The Science of Black Hair – hooded dryers are indirect or diffused heat source.  With indirect heat, there is little or a zero chance of heat damage.
See Also: 7 Myths about Heat and Heat Damage
It’s very beneficial to sit under a dryer during deep conditioning treatments because it will help your conditioner enter the hair more thoroughly. Plus, 30 – 45 mins under the dryer reduces air drying time and helps your style to set and last longer.
Buy: Hooded Dryer
Read: The Disadvantages of the ‘No-Heat Challenge’
Never Skip the Leave-In Conditioner
For some, a leave-in conditioner is optional. Not for me! Especially if I want beautifully, defined curls. I had a hair aha moment (an epiphany, really) when I used Giovanni Direct Leave-In Weightless Moisture Conditioner for the first time.
As I saw my curls defined and popping, I thought, “Yes, this is what I went natural for!” Leaving in your conditioner minimizes frizz, dryness, and flattens the hair cuticle for fewer tangles and moisture loss.
Take A Multivitamin
I know there are a lot of hair supplements on the market but I don’t trust them.  Many of the dosages are unregulated and way above the recommend daily dosage for these particular supplements.
Ingesting nutrients that your body isn’t deficiency of can be disastrous. Hypervitaminosis or vitamin poisoning can lead to adverse side effects such as hair loss, acne, and even death…
Besides many nutrients rely on each other to actually get the job done.  For example, biotin is almost ineffective if taken in the absence of zinc to inhibit shedding.
A simple multivitamin and well-balanced diet is all you need for healthy hair.  Read more about vitamins for healthy hair.
Drink More Water for Hydrated Hair
When it comes to hair care it’s very easy to focus on the external.  It’s the same way with your skin — when you have dry skin or hair, you look for the nearest moisturizer.
Doing this only covers up dryness (not the most effective way to treat it).  Moisturize and nourish your hair and skin from the inside out by drinking water. I notice a huge difference in both my hair and skin when I’m drinking water daily.

IN NATURAL HAIR CARE, PROTECTIVE HAIRSTYLES ON 09/07/19
Box braids give us the freedom to go up to a month or two without the worry of styling, but that doesn’t mean all care goes out of the window! Although you are wearing box braids, you still need to cleanse your hair – especially if you will be wearing them for the long term. This ensures that your scalp won’t become overloaded with buildup, gets itchy or becomes irritated. It also gives your hair much needed contact with good old H20. Here is how you can wash your hair with box braids if you are unsure of how this works:
Always get the itchies when you have a fresh installation of box braids? You may want to soak the hair in ACV first. If you already have installed the hair you can still benefit. Read this: Why You Should Soak Kanekalon Hair in Apple Cider Vinegar
You will need:
Two spray bottles
Shampoo
Conditioner
Towel
A great visual of the process
Dilute the Shampoo and Conditioner that You Will Be Using
Since your hair is braided up, undiluted shampoo or conditioner may be more challenging to remove. Dilute your shampoo and conditioner of choice by:  getting two empty spray bottles, filling them up halfway with water, then adding a few squirts of your shampoo to one bottle and conditioner to the other.
Focus on adding shampoo to your scalp
Your scalp needs the relief from buildup the most, which is why you will start by focusing most of your efforts there. Take your diluted shampoo mixture and apply to your scalp section by section. With your fingertip, massage the shampoo onto your scalp. Be gentle with your roots in order to avoid frizz.
Spray some shampoo onto your ends
Once you have completed applying the shampoo onto all of your scalp, you can then lightly mist your mixture on the rest of your hair. Remember, once you start washing, the shampoo will naturally flow onto the length of your hair which you don’t have to go too crazy with applying it on your ends.
Rinse
You can now go to the shower or your sink to rinse the shampoo out of your hair (bring your conditioner spray bottle with you). Be sure to rinse thoroughly.
Condition
Spray the conditioner mixture on the length of your hair. Let it sit for at least 5 minutes or so then rinse.
Remove Excess Water
Wring and squeeze your hair out first. Then wrap a towel around your hair and let it set for 10 minutes. It will take a couple of hours for your hair to dry completely.

Hair Breakage: 10 Ways to Stop It From Happening

IN FEATURED ON 09/07/19
Hair Breakage happens… We’ve all dealt with at one time or another.
Although it’s nearly impossible to completely eliminate breakage there are some preventative measures that you can take.
See also: 5 Ways to Prevent Breakage in the Middle of Your Head
See also: 5 Ways to Treat & Regrow Edges
First, let’s discuss what causes breakage
There are 3 common types of breakage:
Mechanical/manual (breakage from combing or manipulating)
Physical (breakage caused by heat appliances or physical elements such as winter air)
Chemical (breakage caused by chemical treatments such as relaxers, Brazilian blow outs, or Keratin Treatments.
1. Stop The Breaking Behavior
Once you’ve narrowed down the cause of your breakage stop what you’re doing to cause it.
If you notice more breakage or any hair loss, assess your routine and eliminate the breaking behavior. What’s important to remember is anything in excess can be damaging. This includes your regular maintenance. The key is to pay attention and be mindful of how you’re hair looks and feels.
2.  Learn the Best Ways to Handle Your Hair
As my hair gets longer, I have to make gradual changes to care for it.  That means preventing breakage by sometimes pre-pooing (pre-shampoo treatment) with coconut oil, using olive & coconut oil for an oil rinse, and shampooing in twists or plaits.  Experiment with extra measures to minimize breakage in your hair.
3. Deep Condition Regularly
I deep condition almost weekly to add an extra boost of moisture and breakage prevention.  After deep-conditioning with any one of these 5 deep conditioners, you’ll notice less breakage and shedding.
4. Detangle Damp Not Wet Hair
Hair is its most fragile when wet. If you have highly textured hair that tangles easily, it’s best to lightly mist hair and detangle with a wide tooth comb before shampooing.
Shampooing in plaits or jumbo twists also prevents tangles and breakage, especially for type 4c.  Read more on detangling damp vs. wet
Read: 10 Things Keeping Your From Long Hair
5. Trim Those Dead Ends
I know if seems counterproductive when you’re trying to grow your hair. But removing split ends is the only way to prevent further damage on other parts of the same strand where split ends are present.
Whether you “search and destroy”, “dust”, or allow a professional stylist to trim it, it will help keep it in optimal shape and decrease breakage.
6. Choose The Best Detangling Tool
There are tons of detangling tools and some are better than others when it comes to detangling with little or no damage at all.  Tools like the Tangle Teezer (Tangle Teezer has been nicknamed the ‘Shredder’ by some.)  The best detangling tool regards of hair type is a seamless wide-tooth comb.  NHR Contributor, Latoya swears that this $20 comb is worth every penny.
7. Moisturize As Needed
Hair needs the perfect balance of moisture and protein to remain healthy or breakage free.  Here’s a great visual demonstration on how that works.  Hydrated hair is not easily broken. If you notice popping of hair strands, that’s a good sign that moisture is needed.
8. Don’t Over Do It With Moisturizing
There is a such thing as over-moisturizing. Your hair will feel spongy especially if you deep condition overnight, practice baggy or greenhouse effect too often. You can remedy this by incorporating a protein-based deep conditioning treatment. You can read more about Protein Deep Conditioners.
9. Pay Due Respect To Your Scalp
A healthy scalp is essential to growing healthy hair.  Cleansing your scalp at least bi-weekly and keeping your scalp moisturize can prevent hair loss and scalp irritation. 4 Must-Have for Your Scalp.
10. Give Your Ends Extra TLC
Your ends are both the oldest part of your hair and the most fragile.  They need a little extra attention.  Make sure you have your ends covered by applying the product from ends to roots.  This is especially important when using the LOC method to moisturize hair.

10 Things I Wish I Would’ve Known About My 4C Hair…
If you’re like me and have 4c Hair these 10 tips will change your life!
Well maybe not your life, but it certainly will make your 4C hair so much easier to work with.
Looking back I wish I knew this information because it would have made my transition to natural hair a whole lot easier.
Use these tips and transform your 4C hair’s health and manageability…
1. This goes for most natural girls, but especially for 4C ladies never comb your hair when it is bone dry. When you do this you are asking for breakage galore, not to mention a tough time even getting through your hair.
It is best to comb damp hair but if you like to style your hair while it is dry, always put in a product that will give you tons of slip before you comb.
2. Avoid using small tooth combs for detangling 4C hair. This is just asking for it! Always use a wide tooth comb or even try finger detangling your hair for a more gentle approach. Like these: Anne Bamboo Wide Tooth Comb or Bass Wooden Brush.
3. Try not to use brushes on 4C hair at all. To new naturals this may sound funny, but yes try to eliminate your usage of brushes. Brushes rip and pull at your hair causing splits and breakage.
If you must use a brush for your edges or your nape, use a boar bristle brush, infrequently. Brushing will thin your hair out so fast; every time I see someone over brushing their hair it makes me cringe a bit. Girl you are losing so much hair doing all that!
4. Wash n’ gos may not be for you, especially if you like curl definition. For many 4C ladies this “shortcut” will not be the route you want to take. If having no definition is cool with you, then by all means try it!
However, be prepared for massive shrinkage and matting with your 4C hair.
You may be better off doing a faux wash n’ go, which I outlined here.
5. You don’t have to do anything special to 4C hair when you go to bed.  Put your hair in a sloppy ponytail or very chunk twists, the goal is just to prevent your hair from matting.
If you go to bed with only a bare bones fro, overtime, your hair will become matted, tangled, and the end result will be breakage.
6.  For some of us wet styling just doesn’t work on our 4C hair! In fact, it may cause tangles, matting, and severe shrinkage.
When you air dry your hair first you will get a more stretched out result for your style and there are less tangles to deal with.
7. You can use water to moisturize your hair. The trick to using water on 4C hair is4  do not saturate it; lightly spritz it!
You will find that sometimes using product throughout the week is not enough. In some cases, you may need just a touch of water to restore the balance.
8. Choose 4C friendly hairstyles that you can stick to for at least a week and that do not require tons of daily styling. The less you have to manipulate your 4C hair the better.
Lately my puff has been my go to style, because I simply moisturize when needed and go. I loved to use the Puff Cuff.
9.  Have a trouble spot? The center of my head seems to be the driest and kinkiest texture. If you can relate, the best way to deal with this is by applying more moisture and conditioner to this area.
Also try to lay off heat in this area and when you do use it use a lower setting to avoid dryness.
10. Conditioner is your friend! Try to deep condition 4C hair as often as possible. This will help with moisture issues, plus it will improve your hair’s manageability.
Some good conditioners for 4C hair, that I recommend are:
Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner  
Carol’s Daughter Black Vanilla Smoothie
OBIA Naturals Babassu Deep Conditioner
Qhemet Biologics Cocoa Tree Detangling Ghee

What is an Oil Rinse?
An oil rinse has been compared to a hot oil treatment done in the shower after shampooing and before conditioning your hair.
This is something that I do year round. It has changed the way I moisturize my hair.
What Does It Do?
We all know the LOC Method is one of the best ways to moisturize even the driest of hair. [Read More about the LOC Method]
But did you know the oil you use and in what order, in which you use it, really makes a difference.
Penetrative oils have the molecular structure that allows them to enter the hair.  Since penetrating oils can enter the hair shaft they can also bind to water inside the hair.  There are only 3 oils that have been proven to absorb or penetrate into hair. These oils are coconut oil, olive oil, and avocado oil.
(Read more about Why These Are the 3 Best Oils for Hair.)
You can mix all three together, just two or use them separately.  I like to mix olive oil and coconut oil for my hair.
Applying one of these three oils can help your hair hold on to water. It’s guaranteed to leave your hair soft and moisturize, without a weighed down feel.
Oil Rinse Directions
After shampooing, you apply a liberal amount of hair penetrating oils like olive, avocado, or coconut oil, followed by conditioner. Let it sit for about 3 – 5 minutes and rinse with cool water.  Repeat as frequently as needed.
More Benefits of Oil Rinse
moisture retention
easier detangling
less single strand knots
eliminates frizz
leaves hair smoother & softer

Whenever I use ACV I use it INSTEAD of shampoo. Because it is meant to cleanse your scalp and get rid of build up there is no need to also use shampoo. I also dilute my ACV with water, but I have a sensitive scalp.

OK, that isn’t all I want – I have a whole Amazon Wishlist!  But I just love that Amazon tapped THE Mariah Carey to curate her own holiday shopping list! Click here to check out her whole list, filled with fan essentials, music, and Mariah’s favorite things. For the most part, her picks are as luxe as you might expect – take for example, this $399 Bluetooth USB LED lighted mirror. And that Malouf down comforter sounds divine!
Mariah’s got some truly random stuff on there, like a Pac-Man home arcade game (less expensive than I would have thought) and one of those cool Coravin wine preservation systems I’m so intrigued by. But what I am MOST interested in is the TEA. Mariah Carey’s got her own specialty chai tea blend and it sounds delicious!
Mariah’s chai is made by Vahdam Tea – they also make the turmeric gift set that’s on Oprah’s favorite things list this year. I’m super curious about their blends, they must be super luxurious to make the cut for both Oprah and Mariah Carey. And as a singer, Mariah has long been all about the tea to soothe her throat.
 

Her box set includes a Holiday Breakfast and a Christmas Chai mix. Both sound delicious to me! She thoughtfully paired it with this Ember temperature control Smart Mug and an elegant glass tea kettle. Brilliant. I want it all!
I have yet to try Vahdam Tea, but I’m definitely interested in learning more about their decaf tea blends, since I quit caffeine this year. I do like that Vahdam Teas has a social initiative called TEAch Me, where 1% of their revenue is redirected towards the education of their tea growers’ children. That’s awesome.

Apparently National Pumpkin Day was on October 26th and I totally missed that. I personally celebrate my love of all things pumpkin much closer to Thanksgiving. I love the pumpkin pies, cakes, cookies and muffins – I also love a savory pumpkin stew or other dish. And I take my love of pumpkin to another level, because I also love any kind of pumpkin skincare.
Pumpkin contains vitamin B, vitamin C, and vitamin E, plus beta-carotene, so they’re good for you inside and out. Check out these helpful posts that explain those benefits better than I could. When I use a good pumpkin based or even just pumpkin-enhanced beauty product, I can see and feel a difference in my skin – it’s softer and brighter. Here are some of my favorite pumpkin beauty skincare products so you can try for yourself.

Urban Skin Rx Purifying Pumpkin Pore Mask – If you haven’t yet tried Urban SkinRx, definitely add them to your list to check out! Medical aesthetician Rachel Roff founded this clinical skincare line and created her scientifically researched corrective skin care products for all shades of beautiful. This Purifying Pumpkin Pore Mask smells like dessert, it’s self-warming so it feels like a winter treat, and it combines clay and exfoliating jojoba beads so you can exfoliate as soon as you’re ready to wash off your mask.
The Repêchage FUSION™ Pumpkinfina Multivitamin Mask includes pumpkin and vanilla, so it smells amazing AND has incredible skincare benefits. The Vitamins A and C from pumpkin are intended to help refine your complexion and restore moisture. Vanilla contains B vitamins, niacin, thiamin and panthothenic acid. All in all, this mask leaves my face feeling super soft and incredibly clean (but not stripped of all moisture).
Olive + M’s Pumpkin Enzyme Polish + Mask looks like pudding, smells good enough to eat, and delivers bright, smooth, moist skin improving vitamins in a soft, slightly scrubby mask. The brand is all about clean and conscious ingredients – check them out on Amazon! Besides yummy pumpkin, this mask involves olive oil, cinnamon, plant enzymes and sea salt. My face feels really moisturized after using this one.
Yensa’s 2-in-1 Pumpkin Tumeric Radiance Polishing Mask is unusual amongst the pumpkin skincare products I’ve tried – it’s a gel-like mask with a gritty exfoliant, so I am especially gentle when I use it. It’s got pumpkin, turmeric, ginger, papaya and grapefruit. It applies like a thin gel that’s almost clear, smells divine. Apply to clean, damp skin, leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes and rinse gently for glowing radiance. PS – Yensa is the sister brand to Purlisse, both founded by Jennifer Yen, both cosmetics brands that use fruit and fruit acids as key ingredients!
SheaMoisture’s 100% Premium Pumpkin Seed Oil is pure, nourishing and has become a staple in my skincare routine already. I love their 100% oils – the whole Beauty Hack concept is smart, and the products are so effective. I typically use a few drops of Pumpkin Seed Oil over my serums or acids, but SheaMoisture sent me a new skincare recipe to try (and share with you)!
SheaMoisture’s Pumpkin Seed Oil Skincare Recipe:
Step 1: 1 tablespoon of Pumpkin Seed Oil
Step 2: 3 drops of Jojoba Oil
Step 3: Apply to skin after cleansing and toning
Step 4: Allow to penetrate the skin for at least 10 minutes before applying moisturizer and other products
Hair Recipe:
Step 1: Wet your hair with warm water
Step 2: Add 3 drops of Pumpkin Seed Oil to the palm of your hand
Step 3: Add 2 drops of Almond Oil to your palm
Step 4: Rub your palms together to provide warmth to the oils, then evenly distribute the oils to your damp hair
 Leave it on for at least 30 minutes then wash it out and proceed with your usual shampoo and conditioning routine.
 
Those are the pumpkin skincare products I’ve tried and can confidently rave about. Next on my list, I want to try that Bliss Pumpkin Powerhouse mask. What’s your favorite pumpkin skincare product? Tell me in the comments — I’m always looking for something new to try!

I’ve shared my top kitchen items a few times, and around this time of year I start thinking about sharing more of this kind of information. Why? Because right around now, I’m cooking so often and using so many of my favorite kitchen items! Also, I find that these are the kinds of helpful holiday gift idea lists I’m looking for myself. My kitchen is pretty much packed to capacity, yet I still yearn for new things and am always browsing kitchen listicles. What do I want this year? This glorious loaf pan from Nordic Ware and the new Great Jones sheet pan looks amazing. What am I currently using in my own kitchen that I’d recommend to anyone? Read on for that!
My husband and I have been married for 17 years now and I still remember the fun of going to the store with that little price scanner thing to pick out all the items to make our new home complete. Back then, we had limited options – we chose Bed Bath and Beyond and Pier One. This was before Target and Walmart had stepped up their game to become a force in home décor, and before Amazon was known for much more than books. We went to the store and swiped for the items we thought we needed. And 17-almost-18 years on some of those items have worn well and others, we shouldn’t have asked for at all.
This post began because I thought it would be helpful to round up a list of those tried, true and tested items that we have truly found useful to us as a couple that cooks often. I’m not talking about fancy crystal or fine china, I mean the stuff you will use all the time. This may be useful to you if you’re shopping for your dream kitchen items for Thanksgiving or Christmas, shopping for a friend’s wedding, registering for your own, or just setting up your kitchen with items that will last and last.
 

 
11 Gifts That Should Last (At Least) A Decade
Kitchen Aid stand mixer – We have had ours for 17 years. My mother-in-law has had hers for 35 years. They’re both still working! Your Kitchen-Aid mixer is truly the kitchen workhorse, a beautiful piece of equipment that can set the color scheme for the rest of your appliances. Plus you can make just about anything with it.
Lodge cast iron cookware I’ve raved over mine in several posts here before. I still love and use my Lodge cast iron daily and as someone who’s been diagnosed as anemic in the past it’s an intentional act to get more iron in my life in all of the ways, PLUS these pots are amazing. I use either my 10” or 12” skillet almost every day. Also, there’s this preconceived notion that cast iron pots are hard to clean and that just isn’t true – you just have to make sure to dry them properly to prevent rust. And yes, you can wash your cast iron with soap – click here to see for yourself!
Breadmaker Breadman Ultimate – I debated including my Breadman, because truth be told – it’s not making as aesthetically pleasing a loaf as it used to. But to be fair, our Breadman is officially 17 years old and it’s been pretty consistent in turning out great loaves and incredible pizza dough for 17 years. Even though my loaves aren’t as pretty anymore, they’re still good and totally edible. I read excellent reviews of newer models, so know if you’re getting one of these it’s gonna last you a while!
Fiestaware  — There’s china that sits in your cabinet and looks pretty, and then there’s Fiesta – everyday china that’s fun, colorful, durable and made for everyday use and mixing and matching. I am an unabashed Fiesta fan and collector. Every piece I have has been of the same consistent great quality, whether it’s a vintage bowl I scored on eBay or a beautiful pitcher sent straight to me from the factory. Can’t recommend enough.
A classic Crock Pot or Instant Pot – I got my first Crock Pot for our wedding 17 years ago and it’s still going strong. I love a good slow cooker that’s simple and basic in instruction. Add your ingredients, set the time and live your life! I got my Instant Pot maybe 2 years ago and it’s a game changer for speeding up your cooking time. You can make things like collards, beef stew and pasta sauce SO much faster than ever before with this thing!
Tea kettle – mine is by All-Clad and I use it daily. It’s lasted forever and is definitely a good, solid investment if you’re a tea fiend like I am.
Foodsaver – I am all the way here for a kitchen appliance that helps to save money and the Foodsaver is DEFINITELY that. It makes fresh produce, meat, leftovers – anything you use it on, really – last so much longer and stay so much fresher. Just today I used it to reseal a bag of salad and then later, a bag of potato chips. Because life is about balance.
Pyrex storage — Sometimes the best, most long lasting gift is the most obvious. If you have a kitchen, you probably already own a Pyrex brand product (or a Pyrex wannabe). But the glass storage sets are an undeniable essential and they’re always coming out with new sets and fun colors and patterns, so a regular degular gift like this can also have personality.
Cuisinart food processor — Another item we got for our wedding that has lasted 17 years. A food processor is such an essential piece of cooking equipment, you can do so much with it! Use it to chop things up, to make dough, to pulverize or puree anything you need!
Kuhn Rikon 4th burner pot — This is the latest tool in my kitchen and I’m already obsessed. I usually find myself cooking on two or three burners, but this tall, slender pot is perfect for the 4th burner so you can make things like rice, asparagus, pasta or green beans while you cook all the other stuff. Plus the lid locks on it so you can strain items really easily.
Braun immersion blender – Currently, I am the proud owner of two Braun immersion blenders. One is over 15 years old and still works great but it’s just super basic and older. The other is the brand spanking new Braun Multiquick 9 hand blender which is so quiet it’s won awards, and it comes with a bunch of attachments making it a true multiuse machine –a beaker, a whisk, a 1.5 cup chopper, a masher, a jug blender/ice crusher and a food processor. If you have a small kitchen, get this and skip the bigger appliances!

Those are my top kitchen gift ideas for those looking to expand their cooking abilities with products meant to last! Hope this is helpful to you or someone else.

As with everything in life, my style has evolved over time. Now I am so much more discerning with my fabric choices. I know the general shape and cut of the clothes that look the most effortless on me. That’s what I’m looking for – effortless style. My main goal is comfort and ease. I want clothes I can slide into and dance in and go for a long walk in a park if the opportunity were to present itself. I don’t want anything I have to iron, steam, fuss over or worry about that much — not for my day to day style choices. I love versatility, I love a dress that can go from day to night with. And I found a brand that represents everything I’m looking for. Bellas, check out Leota – a woman-owned clothing brand that intentionally makes the kinds of dresses I love. Easy, breezy, pretty, unique, and timeless. They’re available online, as well as at stores like Bloomingdales, Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack in both straight and curvy sizes (for those of us who like to try things on first)!  And if you read to the end of this post, there’s a 20% off discount awaiting you!
Leota’s creator, Sarah Carson, worked on Wall Street as an investment banker before founding her fashion line. She was looking for a dress that could transition easily and effortlessly from work to cocktail hour and more, a comfortable dress that didn’t require ironing or dry cleaning. Necessity became the mother of invention and that led Sarah to NYC’s busy garment district, where she found the design partnership she was looking for. According to that NY1.com article, “today she is paying NYC’s factories back with her loyalty; making 200-thousand pieces a year all NYC-made.”
Together with her team, they create unique patterns and prints with set silhouettes, so if you know what you love then you’ll keep seeing it in new prints and patterns. For example, I love a fit and flare. I love a sleeveless dress with a higher neckline. I now have Leota dresses I can look for by name, in future prints. Because I LOVED how these fit!
 

 
Here I’m wearing the Mindy shirred dress in wild cat chili pepper. Click here to check it out in sizes S-XL and in plus size.

There are so many things I love about this dress!

It’s saucy, spicy, fun, unexpected. And it’s a deep red and purple leopard. Who would have thought? Not me! Plus I love the cut of it. High neck, midi length, a wrap-around belt that’s comfortable. It feels elegant, modern, chic and perfect for all kinds of occasions.


 
The Mindy dress comes in their crepe knit blend, so that’s 94% polyester, 6% spandex. You can wash this in your machine in cold water and it will come out just perfect. Love!
Leota also offers heavier fabrics from fall into winter – their holiday collection is super cute and includes sequins and velvet! Right on time.
Earlier this summer I rocked this one you may have seen on my Instagram.  it’s the Eve dress in jungle jacquard. SUCH a spring, summer, even resort season print. Leota designs their own prints so this isn’t a leaf print you’ll easily find elsewhere. I love the fit of this dress. Swingy, chic, fits me perfectly.

 


I do wish it had pockets, but we can’t have everything. If I were to co-design a Leota dress, it would have pockets. IJS. I have ideas! Call me, y’all.
Click here to check them out at Shop.Leota.com —  and you can enter the code “AFROBELLA20” to get 20% off your entire order (valid for one use per customer, code valid until May 1, 2020)! Visit Leota New York on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

Ever since I turned 40 this year, I’ve been noticing an uptick in targeted advertising. Now I’m inundated with ads about bladder protection, bladder control, urinary incontinence and preventing leakage. All the time. I’m getting these as sponsored ads on Instagram and Twitter or I’m reading an article or blog post, then surprise! There’s a little square ad talking about my bladder. It makes all the sense that targeted ads like this would be following me – according to the National Association For Incontinence (yes indeed) one in five adults over 40 are affected by overactive bladder symptoms. Consequently, there are a ton of leakage protection products on the market like pads and special underwear. But what about being proactive so we won’t really need these kinds of products as much in the first place? That’s where I’m at right now. Knowing that one in five adults of my age will be dealing with this issue is enough to get me thinking about what I could and should do to avoid it as much as possible.
A weak pelvic floor is at the core of many incontinence issues, and there’s a variety of ways you can strengthen your pelvic floor. One way I’ve heard a lot about but didn’t fully understand until recently, were Kegel exercises. I first heard about the power of Kegels via headlines on the cover of Cosmo magazine in the 80’s, and long had seen the exercises positioned as something done to improve your sex life. Turns out, they’re beneficial for much more than that.
Kegel exercises help to strengthen the pelvic floor, which in turn can help with things like bladder leakage or prolapse. Click here to read more about Kegels from the NAFC – their advice is to find out from a physical therapist or medical practitioner if you need to do the exercise often or if your issue is an overworked pelvic floor that needs to be relaxed. So let’s say your pelvic floor is weak and you know you need to strengthen it. If you’re doing Kegels at home, how do you know you’re doing them right? Or for a long enough time to make a difference? Enter the Kegelbell — a product intended to strengthen your pelvic floor.

The Kegelbell was devised by Dr. Stephanie Schull in response to a problem that affected a beloved relative. Her loved one underwent vaginal mesh surgery to help with a weakened pelvic floor, and it resulted in insufferable, long-term pain and side effects. Seeing what her relative endured began Dr. Schull’s path of inquiry, but her research led her to realize how big of a problem pelvic floor issues were.
“It is really after talking with hundreds of women, doing the research through medical studies, and seeing what big business and healthcare was doing — and not doing — that made me start the business,” she explained to me in a recent interview. “Surgical interventions involve permanent implants of plastic that by their nature can too easily lead to compilations that cannot be resolved. For now, the problems aren’t fixable, instead the woman can have chronic pain and/or numbness and chronic infections, and the plastic edges of the permanent implant can cut into the vagina and surrounding tissues in the woman,” says Dr. Schull. Now there is a pelvic mesh recall, but that comes too late for her relative and for the many women who endured this surgery at the recommendations of their doctors. After seeing her loved one go through all of this, Dr. Schull was inspired to come up with a solution. She invented something with intentional weight, literally and medically speaking.
The Kegelbell is a weight training system that makes it easier for women to perform an effective kegel. You get a medical grade silicone insert, and you attach your weight to the long part. Weight A is 30g. Weight B is 60g. Weight C is 120g. Kegelbell is intended to be used for 5 minutes, three times a week. According to Dr. Schull, the benefits are abundant.

 
“Kegelbell will not get you the body you had before the baby or when you were younger, rather it gets you into the best shape of your life no matter your age… The secret is in the weight being outside the body and hanging from a dynamic cord–better, faster, and more effective workouts so in just 5 minutes 3 times a week–you get the results you want,” says Dr. Schull.
So if you’re tired of peeing a little when you sneeze or laugh or insert action here, this is a much less invasive and possibly longer term solution to help mitigate that issue. If you haven’t yet had any urinary incontinence issues, then that’s awesome and congratulations — but pay attention so you’ll know how to hopefully avoid those issues in your future.
The Mayo Clinic has a helpful page on doing kegels for women, and this WebMD page has helpful tips on Kegels for men. Whether you’re doing kegel exercises with or without the assistance of a device, the main point is that they work and they can help. I’m trying to be more consistent, myself. I’m also trying to be more holistic in my self-care practices and recognize the accountability and necessity of tending to my whole self.
Even in writing this, I felt myself being cautious and feeling timid around the topic. Why? If you’re a woman and you’re reading this, you may be experiencing issues with bladder control, prolapse, etcetera. Maybe you’re my age and you’re starting to get messages about bladder leakage issues everywhere you look. As I get older, I realize the ways I’ve let myself be affected by the shame, indoctrination and miseducation I’ve absorbed about my own body. My life’s goal is to leave that behind, to age with strength and continue to step into my power as I grow up. This is another way of doing just that, and of walking the walk when it comes to taking the best possible care of myself from head to toe.
It turns out, Dr. Schull is on the same page as I am, in that regard. She left me with some wise words, and her wisdom is part of what led me to want to write this blog post and share the Kegelbell with Afrobella readers in the first place.
“The thing I personally most want women to know is that all our lives, especially in those formative years growing up, we were taught and sternly told to ignore ‘that’ part of the body. We did so to our detriment. The muscles of the vagina atrophy from neglect and when they do, we get bladder leakage, more painful periods, sexual dysfunction of all kinds, and eventually organs prolapse resulting in hysterectomies and other dire interventions. The message is–there are muscles down there that need us to be in connection with them. Kegelbell is the perfect way to safely, naturally, and painlessly reconnect with the muscles and bring them back to life. And they want to be engaged. In about two weeks of use, changes become apparent. And what does it do for the mind and spirit of the woman? Well, beautiful things happen when our minds are connected to this essential part of our being. So Kegelbell is about healing our minds and bodies from years of miseducation. Time to teach ourselves how to love ourselves since we had only been taught to repress and deny. When we do strengthen this primordial connection, we radiate in a powerfully beautiful way and we live more fully.” Couldn’t have said it better myself, Dr. Schull.

Dr. Stephanie Schull’s device, the Kegelbell is available at her site, Kegelbell.com — click that link to get 20% off your purchase until November 9th, 2019. Follow on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook @Kegelbell.

Great article.Out community carries a lot of stigma about not only mental illness, but our sexual organs as well. As we age, we need reliable resources to help us navigate the aging process as gracefully as possible. Kudos to you for being advocate and writing about “uncomfortable” topics that we were told to not discuss in public.

For years, my lipstick loving life was all about color. The bolder and brighter, the better. Hello, when given the opportunity to come up with my own color I devised All Of My Purple Life. I LOVE a vibrant lip color. But I also realized that I leaned heavily on color to give me courage.
Red to help me feel like a rockstar. Purple to amplify regality. Fuchsia for ferocity. You get the picture. I hardly ever reached for a true nude look. I thought nude makeup was elegant, beautiful, and mature. A smoky eye and a nude lip is SUCH a staple editorial look, stylish and timeless. But I also thought that I couldn’t pull it off. It just didn’t feel like “me.” I felt like a nude lip made me look washed out instead of enhancing my beauty. Also, I had a hard time finding the RIGHT nude for my skin tone. That’s until Mented came into my life.
Mented Cosmetics makes products that are vegan, paraben free and cruelty free. The brand has been dedicated to creating the perfect range of nude shades for Black beauty — as I always like to say, all shades of beautiful. The creators, Amanda Johnson and KJ Miller, intentionally created a brand that would fill a void in the cosmetics industry. They couldn’t find the perfect nude for them, so they decided to make what they couldn’t find. We’re all better off for their efforts.

Mented started out with lipsticks and glosses in ideal nude shades for deeper skin tones. Now they’ve added red lipsticks, as well as a killer eyeshadow palette, nail polish, stick foundation, and blush. I can’t wait to see what’s next for them!
So far I’ve been lucky enough to try their lipsticks, lip gloss and the eye shadow palette has become a staple for me. Mented got me to wear nudes! Check out these shades and let me know what you think.
Here I’m wearing Mented #5, their signature shade – “a fully pigmented, multi-dimensional blend of brown, purple, and pink.”


This is called Dope Taupe, and it’s so close to my natural lip color it astounds me.


And this shade is called Nude LaLa, a semi-matte brown and pink blend that brings out a peachy/pink shade on me.

All creamy to apply, moisturizing and long lasting. Currently my go-to is Mented # 5 because I’m so used to a deeper contrast in my lipsticks, and it’s a perfect fall shade as well. I do also love blending Dope Taupe and Nude LaLa for a pretty pinky brown shade.
Have you tried Mented yet? You should definitely check them out! Visit their website MentedCosmetics.com, or follow them on social media on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram @MentedCosmetics.
Thank you for sending these samples and for your patience, Mented Cosmetics!

Oh wow! The colors look really good on you. I’ve been seeing amended ads on Instagram but hadn’t really paid attention until now. I will definitely try them out because it is soooo hard finding nudes.

Lately it’s been too hot for cooking. It’s summer, it’s predicted to be a steamy week. When it’s this time of year, we love to eat light and cook less. It’s all about grilling, salads, roasted veggies, mezze platters and for entertaining – a fabulous cheese and charcuterie board. So easy, so pretty, so Instagrammable. I now follow a bunch of cheese board/charcuterie/grazing table accounts online and I love the inspiration.

 
Recently we had a get together at our home and I decided to put together my first ever intentional charcuterie board.  I served it up with Barefoot Wine watermelon Frose and drunken strawberries, and it was a smash! Click here to check out my post and Frose recipe!

 
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve served cheese and light bites at parties for YEARS. But this kind of visually appealing board was new to me and I wanted to get it right so of course I did a ton of research on creating the perfect board. And now I can pass that info along to you, for inspiration!

The very definition of charcuterie is connected to meat, specifically, pork. But I’m over here trying to cut back on my pork consumption. There ARE alternatives to traditional charcuterie boards. Call it a grazing board or cheese board, whatever you prefer.
First things first, check out some of my favorite Instagram accounts around this topic because without their inspiration I wouldn’t be writing this post – definitely check out the hashtags #charcuterie, #grazing board and #Cheeseboard for instant visual amazement. For more detail from actual food writers, check out this Epicurious post, Modern Honey, and also check out Skinnytaste – those posts are really helpful. And this video did a great job of breaking it all down as well.

 
With a board like this, your goal is abundance, color, visual appeal and variety.
The basic components of your spread are as follows:
Crackers/Toasts
Cheese
Meat
Fruit & Veggies
Other Stuff
And the combination of those things are up to you.
I headed straight to Trader Joe’s because I love them and I’m obsessed and they’re conveniently located to me. Here’s what I got in each category and why.

Crackers – There are SO many cracker options, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. My idea is something to suit everyone’s tastes. So I like to go for a super basic water cracker, something bold with flavor, and something nutty or gluten free. I chose Trader Joe’s Pita Bite Crackers which are a touch salty, plain crackers, and their Raisin Rosemary Crisps which are a touch sweet, a touch herbaceous, lots of flavor and goes well with a sweet or salty cheese.
Cheese — In terms of cheese, you want to consider texture. You want a hard cheese, a medium cheese, and a soft cheese. We chose Havarti and a sweet goat cheese covered in blueberries. Another favorite of ours is anything from Sartori cheese – my father-in-law loved their BellaVitano cheese so it’s always a nice memory of him to have some.
Meat – It’s so easy to fill in this part of the blanks, there are so many pre-packaged kits including two or three meat varieties. Consider salami, prosciutto, and always keep visuals front of mind. If It looks good and tastes good, then go for it. Remember these are small, light bites so consider the texture of your meat choice. Tender is the way to go.
Fruit & Veg – Think small, bite sized, lots of color, combines easily with other things. For veggies I typically see carrots, thinly sliced radishes, cucumbers. In terms of fruit, think grapes, berries, cherries, apricots…when in doubt, always go seasonal. You can also consider dried fruit as part of this category. Or you can combine categories here to present bacon wrapped dates, for example. Maybe those belong more in the next category…
Other Stuff – that would be your honey, your olives, your nuts, your dips and/or hummus. Pepper jelly. Some people add pickles. This is the category for your stuffed grape leaves or (see above) bacon wrapped dates. For this board, I got honeycomb and truffle marcona almonds because fancy.
So here’s my complete list, with prices:
Pita Bite Crackers – 2.49
Honeycomb Honey – 6:49
Saltines — $1.99
Raisin Rosemary Crisps $3.99
Blackberries — $3.99
Sliced charcuterie meat sampler — $5.49
Sliced hot Calabrese salami — $2.99
Medjool Dates — $4.99
Blueberry and Vanilla Goat Cheese $4.49
Aged Havarti — $2.80
Truffle Marcona Almonds — $5.99
Grand total — $45.70.
Big enough to feed a party of 5 with plenty left over to spare. Next time I’ll try to add more veggies and fruit, but for a first effort I felt pretty good about it!
